# Stripe Payment Implementation - Dashboard Payment Links

## Current Implementation: Approach "A" ✅

Your project uses **Stripe Dashboard-generated Payment Links** - the simplest and most secure approach for accepting payments.

### How It Works

1. **Create Payment Links in Stripe Dashboard:**
   - Go to your Stripe Dashboard → Products → Payment Links
   - Create payment links for each subscription plan
   - Copy the generated `https://buy.stripe.com/...` URLs

2. **Direct Frontend Redirects:**
   - Users click subscription buttons
   - Frontend redirects directly to Stripe-hosted checkout
   - No backend API calls needed
   - No Stripe keys required in your application

### Current Payment Links

```typescript
// From src/pages/Checkout.tsx and src/pages/Landing.tsx
const pricingPlans = [
  {
    name: 'Student',
    type: 'Monthly',
    price: '€6.99',
    paymentLink: 'https://buy.stripe.com/fZueVd4NQakldJf6owebu03',
  },
  {
    name: 'Student', 
    type: 'Yearly',
    price: '€67.99',
    paymentLink: 'https://buy.stripe.com/aFa4gzfsu5019sZ7sAebu02',
  },
  {
    name: 'Pro',
    type: 'Monthly', 
    price: '€13.99',
    paymentLink: 'https://buy.stripe.com/fZu6oH1BEeAB8oVbIQebu05',
  },
  {
    name: 'Pro',
    type: 'Yearly',
    price: '€134.99', 
    paymentLink: 'https://buy.stripe.com/fZu7sLdkmaklbB7dQYebu04',
  }
];
```

### Benefits of This Approach

✅ **No API Keys Required:** No Stripe keys needed in your .env files
✅ **Maximum Security:** All payment processing happens on Stripe's servers
✅ **No Backend Code:** No Edge Functions needed for checkout
✅ **Stripe-Hosted UI:** Professional, mobile-optimized checkout experience
✅ **PCI Compliance:** Stripe handles all compliance requirements
✅ **Automatic Tax:** Stripe can handle tax calculations automatically

### User Experience

1. User clicks "Choose Plan" button
2. Frontend adds user's email to URL: `paymentLink?prefilled_email=user@example.com`
3. User redirects to Stripe-hosted checkout page
4. After payment, user returns to `/payment-success` page
5. Stripe webhooks handle credit allocation (via `process-payment-success` function)

### Environment Variables

Since you're using payment links, you only need:

```bash
# Frontend (exposed to browser)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="your-supabase-url"
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-supabase-anon-key"

# Backend (Supabase Edge Functions)
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
SITE_URL="http://localhost:8080"  # For webhooks and redirects
```

### What We Removed

- ❌ `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Not needed with payment links
- ❌ `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Not needed for checkout (still used in webhooks)
- ❌ `create-checkout-session` Edge Function - Not needed with payment links

### Webhook Handling

The `process-payment-success` Edge Function still handles Stripe webhooks to:
- Verify payment completion
- Allocate credits to user accounts
- Update subscription status

### Testing

- Use Stripe's test payment links for development
- Test with Stripe's test card numbers
- Verify webhook processing in Supabase logs

### Production Deployment

1. Replace test payment links with live payment links
2. Update webhook endpoints in Stripe Dashboard
3. Set production environment variables in Supabase
4. Deploy to your hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

This approach is perfect for your use case - simple, secure, and maintenance-free!
